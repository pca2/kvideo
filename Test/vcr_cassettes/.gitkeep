# VCR Cassettes

This directory contains VCR cassettes that record HTTP interactions with the YouTube API during testing.

## Important Notes

- Cassettes should be committed to the repository so tests can run without YouTube API credentials
- Sensitive data (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REFRESH_TOKEN) is automatically filtered by VCR configuration
- To re-record cassettes: delete the cassette files and run tests with valid YouTube API credentials
