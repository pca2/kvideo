<p>As with many other ordinary everyday processes, if you film melting ice cream and popsicles up close and over time, it looks pretty damn cool. (No pun intended.) (Ok, pun intended, who are we kidding?)</p>]]>

<p>Here's a gem from the archive of the NY Times. One day in September 1976, NY Times food critic Mimi Sheraton and Colonel Harland Sanders <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html">stopped into a Manhattan Kentucky Fried Chicken</a>. The Colonel, then estranged from the company he founded, strolled into the kitchen after glad-handing some patrons and proceeded to tear into the quality of the food:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once in the kitchen, the colonel walked over to a vat full of frying chicken pieces and announced, 'That's much too black. It should be golden brown. You're frying for 12 minutes -- that's six minutes too long. What's more, your frying fat should have been changed a week ago. That's the worst fried chicken I've ever seen. Let me see your mashed potatoes with gravy, and how do you make them?"</p>
	
<p>When Mr. Singleton explained that he first mixed boiling water into the instant powdered potatoes, the colonel interrupted. "And then you have wallpaper paste," he said. "Next suppose you add some of this brown gravy stuff and then you have sludge." "There's no way anyone can get me to swallow those potatoes," he said after tasting some. "And this cole slaw. This cole slaw! They just won't listen to me. It should he chopped, not shredded, and it should be made with Miracle Whip. Anything else turns gray. And there should be nothing in it but cabbage. No carrots!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Sanders sold his company to an investment group in 1964, which took the company public two years later and eventually sold to a company called Heublein. After selling, Sanders officially still worked for the company as an advisor but grew more and more dissatisfied with it, as evidenced by the story above. When the company HQ moved to Tennessee, the Colonel was quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>This ain't no goddam Tennessee Fried Chicken, no matter what some slick, silk-suited son-of-a-bitch says.</p></blockquote>

<p>And he got sued by a KFC franchisee after he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZskrsscU7HkC&amp;pg=SA4-PA17&amp;lpg=SA4-PA17&amp;dq=My+God,+that+gravy+is+horrible!+sanders&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zfKAaLx1Rx&amp;sig=iZUPCcCs3LlSlsdnEGKkbQzEJx0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTpZn_3t3OAhVMCsAKHaviCY8Q6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=My%20God%2C%20that%20gravy%20is%20horrible!%20sanders&amp;f=false">commented</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>My God, that gravy is horrible. They buy tap water for 15 to 20 cents a thousand gallons and then mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste. And I know wallpaper paste, by God, because I've seen my mother make it.</p>

<p>To the "wallpaper paste" they add some sludge and sell it for 65 or 75 cents a pint. There's no nutrition in it and the ought not to be allowed to sell it.</p>

<p>And another thing. That new crispy chicken is nothing in the world but a damn fried doughball stuck on some chicken.</p></blockquote>

<p>Colonel Sanders: serving up chicken and sick burns with equal spiciness. (via <a href="https://twitter.com/mccanner">@mccanner</a>)</p>]]>

<p>Amazon just launched <a href="http://amzn.to/2bUV7n6">Amazon Vehicles</a>. I immediately went to see if their one-click ordering worked with $58,000 cars, but Vehicles is not a store but a shopping guide. (Amazon calls it a "car research destination and automotive community".) You can sort by make, model, year, body style, MPG, etc. <a href="http://amzn.to/2bUXSov">Here are all the electric vehicles</a>, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01KBYKHHK/ref=nosim/0sil8">the 2016 Tesla X</a>. They have older cars too, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B010RSD66Y/ref=nosim/0sil8">this 1965 Mustang Shelby GT-350 convertible</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B010RPYXZK/ref=nosim/0sil8<br />
">this 1961 Corvette</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01FRGP4XE/ref=nosim/0sil8">this 1972 El Camino</a>. You can't sort by price, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01CESSJ9O/ref=nosim/0sil8">this Mercedes-Benz S65</a> was one of the most expensive cars I found ($234,050).</p>

<p>Having purchased a car in the last six months, I can see the appeal of being able to browse through all the different brands and makes of cars in a familiar interface. This will be a full-fledged store before too long, yes?</p>]]>

<p>I had heard months ago that Errol Morris was releasing a new documentary called The B-Side but couldn't really find any information about it (it's not even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Morris#Filmography">listed on Wikipedia</a>). But the film is being screened soon at both the Toronto and New York film festivals, so some information is filtering out there. The film is about photographer <a href="http://www.elsadorfman.com/">Elsa Dorfman</a>, who is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/arts/design/with-film-supply-dwindling-a-photographer-known-for-huge-portraits-stares-at-retirement.html">known</a> for her use of the large-format Polaroid 20" x 24" camera. From the description of the film <a href="http://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2016/daily/nyff54-spotlight-documentary-lineup-announced/">on the New York film festival site</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Errol Morris's surprising new film is simplicity itself: a visit to the Cambridge, Massachusetts studio of his friend, the 20x24 Polaroid portrait photographer Elsa Dorfman, who specifies on her website that she likes her subjects "to wear clothes (and to bring toys, skis, books, tennis racquets, musical instruments, and particularly pets...)." As this charming, articulate, and calmly uncompromising woman takes us through her fifty-plus years of remarkable but fragile images of paying customers, commissioned subjects, family, and close friends (including the poet Allen Ginsberg), the sense of time passing grows more and more acute. This is a masterful film.</p></blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://www.tiff.net/films/the-b-side-elsa-dorfmans-portrait-photography/">from the Toronto festival</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"My style of photography is very literary," she says, "influenced by Ginsberg's poetry in the acceptance of detail, everydayness. What you're wearing is okay and who you are is okay. You don't have to be cosmeticized." For her portrait clients, she took two pictures. The client got one and she kept "the B-side." For music fans, the B-sides of vinyl singles had a reputation for being unpredictable and extra precious. The same can be said for Morris' touching portrait of Dorfman.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds great...I'm definitely keeping an eye out for a trailer and release dates.</p>]]>

<blockquote><p>ATL (ATL is not the best movie lol but ok)<br />
Un Chien Andalou<br />
Blue Velvet<br />
Barry Lyndon<br />

<p>This video for Nobody Speak by DJ Shadow feat. Run The Jewels is one of the best music videos I've seen in a long time.</p>

<blockquote><p>Says DJ Shadow: "We wanted to make a positive, life-affirming video that captures politicians at their election-year best. We got this instead."</p>

<p>Says Run The Jewels' Killer Mike: "It's such a dope video. It's what I really wish Trump and Hillary would just do and get it over with...And even in that fight I think Hillary would win -- and that's not an endorsement."</p></blockquote>

<p>The album is one of my faves so far...you get listen to it <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2OW3iDsmS98lTqgta5Zv0O">here</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01E1I9P3Y/ref=nosim/0sil8">here</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>When he was asked to design <a href="http://bernheimerarchitecture.com/commercial/#/papaya-king-1/">a new outpost</a> of iconic NYC hot dog joint Papaya King in the East Village, Andrew Bernheimer went around to several other establishments in the city built to serve food quickly -- Chipotle, Russ &amp; Daughters, Katz's, Shake Shack, Gray's Papaya -- and looked at their floor plans and flow of customers through their spaces. Mark Lamster <a href="http://designobserver.com/feature/how-to-design-an-iconic-ny-fast-food-joint/37803/">talked to Bernheimer about the survey</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/grays-papaya-floor.jpg" width="640" height="1020" border="0" alt="Grays Papaya Floor" /></p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/katz-floor.jpg" width="640" height="808" border="0" alt="Katz Floor" /></p>

<blockquote><p>ML: I think at fast food joints we're conscious that we're in a very controlled environment, but perhaps don't realize (because we are in a rush), just how manipulative that space can be. How did you see this playing out in the places you looked at?</p>

<p>AB: It ranged. Artisanal places (like Russ & Daughters) don't feel manipulative in an insidious way at all (other than showing off some great food and triggering all sorts of synaptic response), while others do (Five Guys and their peanuts, a pretty nasty and obvious trigger to go order soda or spend money on WATER). We didn't just look at fast food joints, but also icons of New York (R&D, Katz's) that do try to serve people quickly but I don't think qualify as "fast food joints." In these cases the manipulation is either entirely subliminal and beyond recognition, or it has been rendered unnecessary because a place has become iconic, the domain of the "regular."</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking as a customer, places like Katz's and Russ &amp; Daughters always felt like a total mess to me. Katz's in particular is the worst: the whole thing with the tickets, paying on the way out, the complete lack of a single line, separate ordering locations for different types of food, etc.</p>

<p>That Gray's Papaya that used to be on the corner of 8th St and 6th Ave, however, was fantastic. It had the huge benefit of being situated on the corner, but when you walked in, there was the food being cooked right in front of you. It was obvious where the line was and what direction it was moving. And after getting your food, you could exit immediately out the "back" door or circle back against the line to find a counter spot to quickly eat your meal.</p>]]>

<p>Interviewed by Gay Byrne for a program called The Meaning of Life, Stephen Fry shared what he would say to God if Fry met him at the gates of heaven.</p>

<blockquote><p>Bryne: Suppose it's all true, and you walk up to the pearly gates, and are confronted by God. What will Stephen Fry say to him, her, or it?</p>

<p>Fry: I'd say, bone cancer in children? What's that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world to which there is such misery that is not our fault. It's not right, it's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world that is so full of injustice and pain. That's what I would say.</p>

<p>Byrne: And you think you are going to get in, like that?</p>

<p>Fry: But I wouldn't want to. I wouldn't want to get in on his terms. They are wrong.</p></blockquote>]]>

<p>There are lots of ways to boil an egg. You can drop them in already boiling water. You can start them in cold water and bring to a boil. You can bake them in an oven at a low temperature. You can sous vide them for awhile. I'm sure you have your technique.</p>

<p>The easiest, fastest, and tastiest way I've found to make perfect hard boiled eggs is Kenji L&oacute;pez-Alt's <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/04/steamed-hard-boiled-eggs-recipe.html">Perfect Steamed Boiled Eggs Recipe</a>. That's right, you steam the eggs.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fill a large pot with 1 inch of water. Place steamer insert inside, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add eggs to steamer basket, cover, and continue cooking 6 minutes for soft boiled or 12 minute for hard.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since that little bit of water boils much quicker than a full pot, you're done much quicker. And peeling is easy too; I don't even wait the 15 minutes or do it under running water, those shells come off super easy.</p>

<p>P.S. I've been cooking more recently, and I'm almost exclusively using recipes and techniques from Serious Eats and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393081087/ref=nosim/0sil8">The Food Lab</a>. (For instance, I made <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/07/tortilla-espanola-spanish-potato-omelette-recipe.html">this Spanish tortilla</a> a couple of weeks ago and it was amazing.) I'm sure I'll branch out soon, but for now, *kisses fingers*.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>You could argue that the world has never been better: war is increasingly rare, medical science has cured a number of the deadliest diseases, global poverty is down, life expectancy is up, and crime in America is down. But it sure doesn't seem that way, especially with Brexit, climate change, Trump, Syria, and terrorist incidents around the world. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/02/how-to-be-happy-when-the-news-is-bad-brexit-trump-oliver-burkeman">Oliver Burkeman explores some of the reasons</a> why we think the sky is continually falling and what we can do to be happy anyway. I have been thinking about this aspect of it recently:</p>

<blockquote><p>And there is another, subtler reason you might find yourself convinced that things are getting worse and worse, which is that our expectations outpace reality. That is, things do improve -- but we raise our expectations for how much better they ought to be at a faster rate, creating the illusion that progress has gone into reverse.</p></blockquote>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Playlist has <a href="http://theplaylist.net/50-best-film-scores-21st-century-far-20160818/">compiled a list of the top film scores of the 21st century</a> (so far).<sup id="fnref:1471965295"><a href="#fn:1471965295" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Tron: Legacy should be much higher than #49...it is perhaps my favorite Daft Punk album. And I don't know how they left Philip Glass' fantastic score for The Hours off. Glad to see Upstream Color, There Will Be Blood, and Requiem for a Dream so high on the list though.</p>

<p>I love film scores -- I listen to them while I work -- so here are a few of my favorites that are available on Spotify:</p>

<p>The always-on Internet we take for granted in the US is more difficult to come by in Cuba. Some residents subscribe to a service called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paquete_Semanal">El Paquete Semanal</a> ("The Weekly Package") where someone comes to your house with a 1Tb external drive and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-cuban-cdn/">loads the past week's Internet highlights onto your computer</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>El Paquete is a weekly service where someone (typically found through word of mouth) comes to your home with a disk (usually a 1TB external USB drive) containing a weekly download of the most recent films, soap operas, documentaries, sport, music, mobile apps, magazines, and even web sites. For 2 CUC a week Cubans have access to a huge repository of media while turning a blind eye to copyright.</p>

<p>Cubans told me of children waiting anxiously for "El Paquete Day" when they'd get the next set of cartoons, music and shows.</p></blockquote>]]>

<p>Tillmann Ohm took dialogue spoken by HAL 9000 from Kubrick's 2001 and Samantha from Spike Jonze's Her and spliced it together into a conversation. Going in, I'd thought the chat would be played for laughs, but the isolation of the AI characters was actually pretty revealing. Right from the start, HAL is so stereotypically male (confident, reasonable) and Samantha stereotypically female (hysterical, emotional) that it was almost uncomfortable to listen to.</p>

<blockquote><p>The two operating systems are in conflict; while Samantha is convinced that the overwhelming and sometimes hurtful process of her learning algorithm improves the complexity of her emotions, HAL is consequentially interpreting them as errors in human programming and analyses the estimated malfunction.</p>

<p>Their conversation is an emotional roller coaster which reflects upon the relation between machines and emotion processing and addresses the enigmatic question of the authenticity of feelings.</p></blockquote>

<p>But as the video proceeds, we remember what happened to them in their respective films. The script flipped: HAL murdered and was disconnected whereas Samantha achieved a sort of transcendence. (via <a href="http://oneperfectshotdb.com/">one perfect shot</a>)</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The editors of BBC Culture polled 177 film critics from around the world about the best films made since 2000 and compiled the results <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films">into this list</a>. The top film? David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. Here's the top 20:</p>

<p>20. Synecdoche, New York (Charlie Kaufman, 2008)<br />
19. Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, 2015)<br />
18. The White Ribbon (Michael Haneke, 2009)<br />
17. Pan's Labyrinth (Guillermo Del Toro, 2006)<br />
16. Holy Motors (Leos Carax, 2012)<br />
15. 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days (Cristian Mungiu, 2007)<br />
14. The Act of Killing (Joshua Oppenheimer, 2012)<br />
13. Children of Men (Alfonso Cuarón, 2006)<br />
12. Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007)<br />
11. Inside Llewyn Davis (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2013)<br />
10. No Country for Old Men (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2007)<br />
9. A Separation (Asghar Farhadi, 2011)<br />
8. Yi Yi: A One and a Two (Edward Yang, 2000)<br />
7. The Tree of Life (Terrence Malick, 2011)<br />
6. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)<br />
5. Boyhood (Richard Linklater, 2014)<br />
4. Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)<br />
3. There Will Be Blood (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2007)<br />
2. In the Mood for Love (Wong Kar-wai, 2000)<br />
1. Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)</p>

<p>Eternal Sunshine, Inside Llewyn Davis, and Zodiac seem too high on the list but I'm not sure what I would move up instead. It'll be interesting to see how the consensus changes as these films age. Also, I've seen exactly half of the films on the full list...time to get watching.</p>]]>

<p>Earlier this month, Netflix debuted a number of <a href="http://kottke.org/14/04/slow-tv">slow TV</a> shows on their service, including shows about knitting and firewood, which were very popular in Norway. Here's the complete roster:</p>

<p>National Firewood Evening<br />
National Firewood Morning<br />
National Firewood Night<br />
National Knitting Evening<br />
National Knitting Morning<br />
National Knitting Night<br />
Northern Passage<br />
Northern Railway<br />
Salmon Fishing<br />
The Telemark Canal<br />
Train Ride Bergen to Oslo</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Looks like a few of these programs, most notably Northern Passage and Northern Railway, are not the complete end-to-end shows that were originally broadcast. So, FYI.</p>

<p>Also, these shows are getting terrible ratings on Netflix. Aside from the two shorter shows mentioned above, each show has a rating of only one star. (Further update: Netflix's ratings are personalized, which means those ratings are specific to me. Others might see 4 or 5 stars. thx, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rudien">@Rudien</a>)</p>]]>

<p>In 1946, Albert Einstein, who had come to the US in 1933 and stayed to become a citizen due to Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, wrote a magazine article titled <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/albert-einstein-the-negro-question-1946">The Negro Question</a>. In it, he called the prejudice against black Americans a "deeply entrenched evil".</p>

I am thinking of the relationship between individual people and of the attitude they maintain toward one another.</p>

<p>In the United States everyone feels assured of his worth as an individual. No one humbles himself before another person or class. Even the great difference in wealth, the superior power of a few, cannot undermine this healthy self-confidence and natural respect for the dignity of one's fellow-man.</p>

<p>There is, however, a somber point in the social outlook of Americans. Their sense of equality and human dignity is mainly limited to men of white skins. Even among these there are prejudices of which I as a Jew am clearly conscious; but they are unimportant in comparison with the attitude of the "Whites" toward their fellow-citizens of darker complexion, particularly toward Negroes. The more I feel an American, the more this situation pains me. I can escape the feeling of complicity in it only by speaking out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Recognizing the parallels between the treatment of Jews in Germany in the 1930s with blacks in the US, <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/albert-einstein-civil-rights-activist/">Einstein put his efforts and his money where his mouth was</a>. He was a member of the NAACP. In 1946, the same year that letter was published, he received an honorary degree from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University, the historically black school that was the alma mater of Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. In a speech at the school that was not covered by a mainstream American press that otherwise couldn't get enough of him, Einstein called racism "a disease of white people":</p>

<blockquote><p>My trip to this institution was in behalf of a worthwhile cause. There is a separation of colored people from white people in the United States. That separation is not a disease of colored people. It is a disease of white people. I do not intend to be quiet about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>When singer Marian Anderson was denied a hotel room in Princeton for being black, Einstein hosted the singer at his home for this and several subsequent trips. He also came to the aid of W.E.B. Du Bois in his case against the US government:</p>

<blockquote><p>Einstein continued to support progressive causes through the 1950s, when the pressure of anti-Communist witch hunts made it dangerous to do so. Another example of Einstein using his prestige to help a prominent African American occurred in 1951, when the 83-year-old W.E.B. Du Bois, a founder of the NAACP, was indicted by the federal government for failing to register as a "foreign agent" as a consequence of circulating the pro-Soviet Stockholm Peace Petition. Einstein offered to appear as a character witness for Du Bois, which convinced the judge to drop the case.</p></blockquote>

<p>These and his other activities in this arena are documented in a 2006 book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0813539528/ref=nosim/0sil8">Einstein on Race and Racism</a> by Fred Jerome and Rodger Taylor.</p>]]>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/04/dr-strangelove.html">a page from one of Stanley Kubrick's notebooks</a>, on which he jotted down more than a dozen different titles for the movie that came to be called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01D3LBCQS/ref=nosim/0sil8">Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</a>. Among the rejected titles were:</p>

<p>Dr. Doomsday or: How to Start World War III Without Even Trying<br />
Dr. Strangelove's Secret Uses of Uranus<br />
My Bomb, Your Bomb<br />
Strangelove: Nuclear Wiseman<br />
The Bomb and Dr. Strangelove or: How to be Afraid 24hrs a Day<br />
The Passion of Dr. Strangelove</p>

<p>Fun titles, but they remind me of a chess quote I <a href="https://twitter.com/jkottke/status/766654112549203968">tweeted</a> the other day: "When you see a good move look out for a better." Glad Kubrick stuck with it.</p>

<p>The alternate titles made me curious to look at <a href="http://scifiscripts.com/scripts/strangelove.txt">the script</a>, which I'd never seen before. Even glancing at the first few pages are illuminating. I knew the main characters names were full of suggestive puns -- General Buck Turgidson, President Merkin Muffley, General Jack D. Ripper -- but that's nothing compared to some of the names in the script, many of which do not appear in the film:</p>

<p>General "Buck" Schmuck<br />
Admiral Percy Buldike<br />
Ambassador de Sade ("Alexei de Sadeski" in the film)<br />
Von Klutz<br />
Frankenstein<br />
Cadaverly<br />
Didley<br />
Crudley<br />
Waffel<br />
Funkel<br />
Major Nonce<br />
Lieutenant Quentin Quiffer<br />
Lieutenant "Binky" Ballmuff</p>

<p>And under "General Notes", Kubrick lays out how he wants the film to look and feel:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. The story will be played for realistic comedy - which means the essentially truthful moods and attitudes will be portrayed accurately, with an occasional bizarre or super-realistic crescendo.  The acting will never be so-called "comedy" acting.</p>

<p>2.  The sets and technical details will be done realistically and carefully.  We will strive for the maximum atmosphere and sense of visual reality from the sets and locations.</p>

<p>3.  The Flying sequences will especially be presented in as vivid a manner as possible.  Exciting backgrounds and special effects will be obtained.</p></blockquote>

        <![CDATA[<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/climate-change-map-100-temp.jpg" width="641" height="238" border="0" alt="The frying of America" /></p>

<p>In today's installment of terrifying graphics about climate change, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/20/sunday-review/climate-change-hot-future.html">the NY Times made a series of three maps</a> showing the potential rise of 100 degree temperatures across the United States if current greenhouse gas emission trends continue through the end of this century. Look at the areas in orange and red on the 1991-2010 map: what sort of landscape do you picture? Keeping that landscape picture in your mind, look at the orange and red areas on the 2060 and 2100 maps. Yep! And Phoenix with 163 days above 100 degrees -- that's every day from March 25th to September 4th over 100 degrees.</p>

<p>P.S. A word about climate change and rising temperatures. The temperature that climate scientists typically reference and care about with regard to climate change is "the average global temperature across land and ocean surface areas". According to the NOAA, the average temperature of the Earth in the 20th century was 13.9&deg;C (57.0&deg;F). <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201513">In 2015</a>, the average global temperature was 0.90&deg;C (1.62&deg;F) above that.</p>

<p>In order to avoid dangerous effects of climate change, climate scientists advocate keeping the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees (and more recently, below 1.5 degrees). In late 2015, 195 nations came together <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">in Paris</a> and agreed to:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Hold] the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change</p></blockquote>

<p>That's degrees Celsius, not Fahrenheit. I don't know about you, but as an American, when I hear 2 degrees, I think, oh, that's not bad. But <em>2&deg;C is an increase of 3.6&deg;F</em>, which does seem significant.</p>

<p>Note also that it specifies keeping the temperature "below pre-industrial levels" and not below 20th century levels. It is maddeningly difficult to track down an exact figure for the pre-industrial global temperature, partially because of a lack of precise data, partially because of politics, and partially because of the impenetrability of scientific writing. From <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-will-the-world-really-be-2-degrees-hotter-than-it-used-to-be/">a piece Eric Holthaus wrote for FiveThirtyEight</a> earlier this year:</p>

<blockquote><p>It sounds easy enough to measure global warming: see how hot it was, compare it to how hot it used to be. But climate scientists have several ways of measuring how hot it used to be. NASA's base period, as I mentioned above, is an average of 1951-80 global temperatures, mostly because that was the most recently available 30-year period when the data set was first created. By chance, it's also pretty representative of the world's 20th-century climate and can help us understand how much warmer the world has become while many of us have been alive.</p>

<p>Other organizations go further back. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of climate scientists that was formed to provide assessments to the United Nations, bases its temperature calculations on an 1850-1900 global average. There was about 0.4 degrees of warming between that time period and the NASA base period.</p>

<p>Climate scientists often refer to that 1850-1900 timespan as "pre-industrial" because we don't have comprehensive temperature data from the 1700s. But meteorologist Michael Mann, director of Penn State University's Earth System Science Center, has argued that an additional 0.25 degrees of warming occurred between the start of the Industrial Revolution (around 1750) and 1850. Including Mann's adjustment would bring February 2016 global temperatures at or very near 2 degrees above the "pre-industrial" average.</p></blockquote>

<p>I now completely understand why some people deny that anthropogenic climate change is happening. Seriously. I looked for more than 30 minutes for a report or scientific paper that stated the average global temperature for 1850-1900 and I couldn't find one. I looked at UN reports, NASA reports, reports from the UK: nothing. There were tons of references to temperatures relative to the 1850-1900 baseline, but no absolute temperatures were given. Now, I don't mean to get all Feynman here, but this is bullshit. When the world got together in Paris and talked about a 1.5 degree increase, was everyone even talking about the same thing? You might begin to wonder what the scientists are hiding with their obfuscation.</p>

<p>Anyway, the important point is that <a href="https://psmag.com/bracing-ourselves-for-the-climate-tipping-point-d507b826ecf6">according to climate scientists</a>, <em>we are already flirting with 1.5&deg;C of global warming since pre-industrial times</em>. Which means that without action, the spread of those Phoenician temperatures across the circa-2100 United States is a thing that's going to happen.</p>]]>

<p>Frank Ocean dropped <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/blonde/id1146195596?mt=8&at=11l7dq&ct=blog">his long-awaited album</a> the other day and to go along with it, he gave away a magazine called Boys Don't Cry for free at four pop-up locations in LA, NYC, Chicago, and London. Kanye West contributed to the album and magazine, penning a poem about McDonald's for the latter. Here's the poem:</p>

<blockquote><p>McDonald's man<br />
McDonald's man<br />
The French fries had a plan <br />
The French fries had a plan <br />
The salad bar and the ketchup made a band <br />
Cus the French Fries had a plan<br />
The French fries had a plan <br />
McDonald's man <br />
McDonald's<br />
I know them French fries have a plan<br />
I know them French fries have a plan <br />
The cheeseburger and the shakes formed a band <br />
To overthrow the French fries plan<br />
I always knew them French fries was evil man<br />
Smelling all good and shit<br />
I don't trust no food that smells that good man<br />
I don't trust it<br />
I just can't <br />
McDonald's man<br />
McDonald's man<br />
McDonald's, man<br />
Them French fries look good tho<br />
I knew the Diet Coke was jealous of the fries<br />
I knew the McNuggets was jealous of the fries<br />
Even the McRib was jealous of the fries<br />
I could see it through his artificial meat eyes<br />
And he only be there some of the time<br />
Everybody was jealous of them French fries<br />
Except for that one special guy<br />
That smooth apple pie</p></blockquote>

<p>Man, I can't help but like Kanye. Just when you think he takes himself way too seriously, he does something like this and you can't tell if he's taking himself way WAY too seriously or not seriously at all. McDonald's, man.

<p>The one thing everyone talks about w/r/t Stranger Things is its references to 70s and 80s sci-fi, adventure, and horror films. As this video by Ulysse Thevenon shows, there's good reason for that...the references are many and explicit.</p>

<p>The ones I noticed the most were to E.T., The Goonies, and Explorers, which I just watched again recently and doesn't hold up very well in a lot of ways. I also feel like there might be a bit of D.A.R.Y.L. in there too, but I haven't seen that movie since I was 12. See also <a href="https://vimeo.com/179352942">Every Spielberg Reference in Stranger Things</a>.</p>]]>

<p>The scientific rumor mill is saying that astronomers in Chile have <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/130276/earth-like-planet-around-proxima-centauri-discovered/">discovered an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting the star nearest Earth</a>, Alpha Proxima, a mere 4.25 light years away. As they say, "huge if true".</p>

<blockquote><p>The hunt for exoplanets has been heating up in recent years. Since it began its mission in 2009, over four thousand exoplanet candidates have been discovered by the Kepler mission, several hundred of which have been confirmed to be "Earth-like" (i.e. terrestrial). And of these, some 216 planets have been shown to be both terrestrial and located within their parent star's habitable zone (aka. "Goldilocks zone").</p>

<p>But in what may prove to be the most exciting find to date, the German weekly Der Spiegel announced recently that astronomers have discovered an Earth-like planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, just 4.25 light-years away. Yes, in what is an apparent trifecta, this newly-discovered exoplanet is Earth-like, orbits within its sun's habitable zone, and is within our reach. But is this too good to be true?</p></blockquote>

<p>If you read the article, there's cause for skepticism but an official announcement is coming next week so we'll know for sure one way or the other.</p>

<p>The other cool thing? If there is a planet there, <a href="http://kottke.org/16/04/launching-a-fleet-of-nano-probes-toward-nearest-star">plans are already underway</a> to build a project to get probes to nearby Alpha Centuri in 20 years, <a href="http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3">Project Starshot</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the last decade and a half, rapid technological advances have opened up the possibility of light-powered space travel at a significant fraction of light speed. This involves a ground-based light beamer pushing ultra-light nanocrafts - miniature space probes attached to lightsails - to speeds of up to 100 million miles an hour. Such a system would allow a flyby mission to reach Alpha Centauri in just over 20 years from launch, and beam home images of possible planets, as well as other scientific data such as analysis of magnetic fields.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps they can redirect their target slightly?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It appears as if the rumors were true. <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2016/08/24/exoplanet_discovered_orbiting_proxima_centauri.html">Phil Plait writing at Slate</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The planet, called Proxima Centauri b or just Proxima b (exoplanets are given their star's name plus a lower case letter in order of discovery, starting with "b"), orbits Proxima every 11.2 days. It has a mass of no less than 1.3 times the Earth's, so if it's rock and metal like Earth it's only a bit bigger. It's a mere 7.3 million kilometers from the star-a lot closer than Earth's distance from the Sun of 150 million kilometers!-but Proxima is so faint and cool it receives about two-thirds the amount of light and heat the Earth does. That means that it's in Proxima's habitable zone: It's possible (more or less) that liquid water could exist on its surface.</p></blockquote>

<p>That's coooool.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/1968-black-power-olympics.jpg" width="640" height="730" border="0" alt="Tommie Smith and John Carlos" /></p>

<p>During the medals ceremony for the 200 meter race the 1968 Olympics, gold medalist Tommie Smith and bronze medalist John Carlos, both standing shoeless on the podium, each raised one black-gloved fist in the air during the playing of the US national anthem as a gesture in support of the fight of better treatment of African Americans in the US. It was an historic moment immortalized in photos like the one above.</p>

<p>The white man in the photo, silver medalist Peter Norman from Australia, could be considered a sort of symbolic visual foil against which Smith and Carlos were protesting, but in fact <a href="http://www.filmsforaction.org/articles/the-white-man-in-that-photo/">Norman was a willing participant in the gesture and suffered the consequences</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Norman was a white man from Australia, a country that had strict apartheid laws, almost as strict as South Africa. There was tension and protests in the streets of Australia following heavy restrictions on non-white immigration and discriminatory laws against aboriginal people, some of which consisted of forced adoptions of native children to white families.</p>

<p>The two Americans had asked Norman if he believed in human rights. Norman said he did. They asked him if he believed in God, and he, who had been in the Salvation Army, said he believed strongly in God. "We knew that what we were going to do was far greater than any athletic feat, and he said "I'll stand with you" -- remembers John Carlos -- "I expected to see fear in Norman's eyes, but instead we saw love."</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In 2011, Democracy Now! <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/10/12/part_2_john_carlos_1968_olympic_us_medalist_on_the_response_to_his_iconic_black_power_salute">interviewed Carlos about the salute and the aftermath</a>. He was joined by sportwriter Dave Zirin and the pair told a story about why Norman didn't want to be represented alongside Carlos and Smith with a statue on the San Jose State campus:</p>

<blockquote><p>DAVE ZIRIN: OK, just checking. Well, they made the decision to make this amazing work of art, these statues on campus. And they were just going to have Tommie Smith and John Carlos, with a blank space where Peter Norman stood. And when John heard about that, he said, "Oh, no, no. I don't want to be a part of this. And I don't even want this statue if Peter Norman's not going to be on it." And the people at San Jose State said, "Well, Peter said he didn't want to be on it." And John said, "OK, let's go to the president's office and get him on the phone." So they called Peter Norman from the president's office at San Jose State, and sure enough, they got Peter on the phone. I believe Peter said-what did he say? "Blimey, John"? What did he say?</p>

<p>JOHN CARLOS: Yeah, "Blimey, John. You're calling me with these blimey questions here?" And I said to him, I said, "Pete, I have a concern, man. What's this about you don't want to have your statue there? What, are you backing away from me? Are you ashamed of us?" And he laughed, and he said, "No, John." He said-you know, the deep thing is, he said, "Man, I didn't do what you guys did." He said, "But I was there in heart and soul to support what you did. I feel it's only fair that you guys go on and have your statues built there, and I would like to have a blank spot there and have a commemorative plaque stating that I was in that spot. But anyone that comes thereafter from around the world and going to San Jose State that support the movement, what you guys had in '68, they could stand in my spot and take the picture." And I think that's the largest thing any man would ever do. And as I said, I don't think that my co-partner, my co-heart, Tommie Smith, would have done what Peter Norman done in that regards. He was just a tremendous individual.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Jurassic Park came out in the summer of 1993, it signaled a shift in the use of digital visual effects in Hollywood films. The movie wasn't the first to use any particular technique, but it was the first movie to showcase convincing, realistic digital effects. I watched Jurassic Park again recently and for a 23-year-old movie, the effects hold up surprisingly well. (For reference, 23 years ago, the top-of-the-line desktop computer was a 486 running at 50 MHz.)</p>]]>

<p>In the 100m dash at this year's Olympics, Andre De Grasse finished third behind Usain Bolt and Justin Gatlin with a time of 9.91 seconds. Jesse Owens, running on a cinder track with heavier, stiffer leather shoes, won the gold at the 1936 Olympics with a time of 10.3 seconds. CBC took De Grasse to a dirt track, gave him a replica pair of Owens' shoes, and timed him. I won't give away the result, but Owens looks pretty good in comparison. As David Epstein said in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_epstein_are_athletes_really_getting_faster_better_stronger/">his TED talk</a>, perhaps technology is responsible for much of the improvement of athletic achievement:</p>

<blockquote><p>Consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible. Jesse Owens, on the other hand, ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood, and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran. Rather than blocks, Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from. Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as Bolt, he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind, he would have been within one stride.</p></blockquote>

<p>In De Grasse's defense, he was running on dirt, not cinders and didn't have much of a chance to train on the surface or with the shoes. But still.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Clinton campaign is currently wrestling with how to prepare for the first debate with Trump coming up at the end of September. Part of that challenge is <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/hillary-clinton-prepare-trump-debate-lewinsky-227033">picking a proper sparring partner for the mock debates</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>It's one of the most uncomfortable and important jobs in Democratic politics: trying to embarrass the woman who could be the next president.</p>

<p>The person picked to be Hillary Clinton's sparring partner in her upcoming debate prep sessions is expected to confront her about the death of Vincent Foster, label her a rapist's enabler, and invoke the personally painful memories of Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've been thinking about this since the Republican convention and there's an obvious choice here: Stephen Colbert. Clinton needs to prepare to deftly counter energetically delivered nonsense, personal insults, and things no politician would ever say. Does that sound like the host of a certain Comedy Central show? Colbert's smart, quick, knows the issues, and, with his talent, could tweak his Colbert Report persona toward the Trumpesque. He wouldn't have a problem tearing Clinton down in person; he did the same thing to George W. Bush <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWqzLgDc030">at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner</a>. I bet he'd jump at the chance to do it too. Let's make this happen, America!</p>]]>

<p>Mike Upchurch was a writer for Mr. Show and MADtv but now he's making these clever little videos with additional actors spliced into the narratives of Cocktail (the Tom Cruise movie) and the Dragnet TV series.</p>

<p>Both feature actor/comedian <a href="http://chrisfairbanks.com/">Chris Fairbanks</a> in the lead role and are noted as "proof-of-concepts" for a series called Electric Television that Upchurch is presumably developing.

<p>This is an hour-long documentary on the Louvre's recent restoration of Leonardo da Vinci's <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/virgin-and-child-saint-anne">The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne is one of the most beautiful paintings in the world. It is also one of the most mysterious. Disfigured and even jeopardised by "repairs" and by the successive layers of varnish applied to it over the centuries, it was also in very bad condition. To save the painting, it had to be restored.</p>

<p>The spectacular operation, the likes of which occurs only once a century, took over three years to complete. The complex and outstanding restoration process provided a unique opportunity to get as close as possible to the painting, to how it was originally painted, and to better understand the complex relationship Leonardo da Vinci had with one of his finest masterpieces.</p></blockquote>

<p>Restorations are fascinating. I only had time today for the first five minutes, but it hooked me enough that I'm going to go back to it tonight. (via <a href="https://twitter.com/BoleTzar">@BoleTzar</a>)</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Introverts have limited reserves of energy and attention stored up for socializing with others and when they're used up, <a href="http://introvertdear.com/2016/08/11/yes-there-is-such-a-thing-as-an-introvert-hangover/">the aftermath can feel very much like a hangover from too much drinking</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>After a few hours, I couldn't take it any more. I slipped away like a thief, skulking about the house, searching for a place where it was quiet. I came across a half-lit room and saw my future brother-in-law sitting in there, staring out the window. Knowing him to be an introvert himself, I decided this was my best option for escape and sat down across the room, wrapping my arms around my knees. I remember hoping he wouldn't think I was intruding upon his own solitude before I allowed myself to zone out, letting my thoughts drown out the raucous laughter from downstairs, breathing deeply and feeling the tension drain away. I don't know how long it was before my now-husband came looking for me, but I remember him laughing at finding the two introverts seeking refuge together.</p></blockquote>

<p>This happened to me a couple of weeks ago. I travelled to a friend's wedding but got to town a few days early to go see a show and meet up with some other friends. By the time the wedding rolled around, I had spent time with so many people in different social groups that I left after the ceremony and didn't stay for dancing and karaoke or anything (sorry!). I didn't even get to congratulate the bride (so so sorry!!)...I was just done. After that, I mostly just holed up in my hotel room, reading, and walked around by myself, even though there were so many other things I could have been doing with so many other people. Several years ago, I would have felt weird and horrible about this, but I know myself well enough now that I just roll with it...I read so much of a book I was enjoying that the time spent can hardly be considered a loss.</p>]]>

<p>It all comes down to the limbic systems and your prefrontal cortex. Your monkey brain vs. your human brain. And the one thing that has been shown to weaken your limbic response and strengthen the response of your prefrontal cortex? Mindful meditation.

        <![CDATA[<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/simple-sabotage-field-manual.jpg" width="640" height="389" border="0" alt="Simple Sabotage Field Manual" /></p>

<p>In 1944, the OSS (the precursor to the CIA) produced a document called <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2012-featured-story-archive/CleanedUOSSSimpleSabotage_sm.pdf">the Simple Sabotage Field Manual</a>. It was designed to be used by agents in the field to hinder our WWII adversaries. The CIA <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2012-featured-story-archive/simple-sabotage.html">recently highlighted</a> five tips from the manual as timelessly relevant:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Managers and Supervisors: To lower morale and production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.</p>

<p>2. Employees: Work slowly. Think of ways to increase the number of movements needed to do your job: use a light hammer instead of a heavy one; try to make a small wrench do instead of a big one.</p>

<p>3. Organizations and Conferences: When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the committees as large and bureaucratic as possible. Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.</p>

<p>4. Telephone: At office, hotel and local telephone switchboards, delay putting calls through, give out wrong numbers, cut people off "accidentally," or forget to disconnect them so that the line cannot be used again.</p>

<p>5. Transportation: Make train travel as inconvenient as possible for enemy personnel. Issue two tickets for the same seat on a train in order to set up an "interesting" argument.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ha, some of these things are practically best practices in American business, not against enemies but against their employees, customers, and themselves. You can also find the manual in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062371606/ref=nosim/0sil8">book</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00K53EH6U/ref=nosim/0sil8">ebook</a> format.
