<p>I love <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_2016_brand_new_conference_by_underconsideration.php">this design work</a> from <a href="http://underconsideration.com/">UnderConsideration</a> for their <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/">recent conference</a> in Nashville. It&#8217;s got a Western rhinestone + woodtype vibe but it also feels digital &#8212; the first thing that popped into my head when I saw that gorgeous F was a circuit board. Wonderful.

<p>The trailer for the third season of Charlie Brooker&#8217;s excellent Black Mirror just dropped. If you haven&#8217;t seen the first two seasons, I&#8217;d recommend catching yourself up. And did I spy Mackenzie Davis and Kelly Macdonald in the trailer? I did, I did. The new season starts October 21 on Netflix.</p>]]>

<p>EA Sports&#8217; FIFA is one of the most popular sports video games in the world. But it&#8217;s also a challenging game to master, which can make for some blooper-filled afternoons with your mates. In these two videos, real players get out onto the pitch to imitate the mannerisms and slip-ups of their video game counterparts.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hello! For today&#8217;s installment of I Totally Didn&#8217;t Know This, we&#8217;re going to talk about voice doubles. When you&#8217;re making a movie or a TV show and you&#8217;re in the editing phase, cutting a trailer, or doing promotional videos, sometimes you need some extra dialogue that you didn&#8217;t get during the main filming. So you get the actor to come in to do the new dialogue. But sometimes, if the actor is famous and super busy, they might not be available. So there are voice actors whose job it is to impersonate the real actor&#8217;s voice. Saaaaay whaaaaat?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an example of ADR, Automated Dialogue Replacement. Amy Landecker, who plays Sarah Pfefferman on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00I3MOT0Y/ref=nosim/0sil8">Transparent</a>, has done this job for movies starring Julia Roberts. She sounds amazingly like Julia:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/37VhTWokgNU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>She even did most of Julia&#8217;s dialogue in this Duplicity trailer:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLiCbVyO0F4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Jim-Hanks/">Jim Hanks</a> has done voiceover work for his brother Tom in the past:</p>

<p>He does the voice for Woody in all the Toy Story video games&#8230;it&#8217;s not an exact match, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs1DYdy0Qk8">it&#8217;s pretty good</a>.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Nolan North voice doubles for Christopher Walken.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/isabelle-mege.jpg" width="800" height="582" border="0" alt="Isabelle Mege" /></p>

<p>Isabelle M&egrave;ge does not call herself an artist, but she has nonetheless been working on an interesting project for the last 30 years. M&egrave;ge contacts photographers she likes and asks them to incorporate her into their work, keeping a copy of each photograph afterwards. She has over 300 photographs and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-opposite-of-a-muse">has curated 135 of them into what she calls &#8220;the collection&#8221;</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>After each shoot, M&egrave;ge would follow up and ask the artist for a print, signed and sometimes numbered by its edition. The print would go into her archive, along with any artifacts related to its making; Elkoury&#8217;s letter, for instance, is accompanied in the archive by M&egrave;ge&#8217;s notes about their encounter (he was late to their first meeting, and arrived with his shoelaces untied). Also in her archive are the heels that Witkin attached to her feet during the 1990 shoot, and a news item about Japanese customs having seized incoming copies of the magazine ARTnews to prohibit their circulation; the photograph, in which M&egrave;ge&#8217;s pubic hair is visible, was considered obscene. Her diarizing and collection of correspondence, clippings, image reproductions, and relevant items reveal that the planning around certain images often lasted years. Several times, having worked with an artist to make an image, she was unhappy with the results and excluded it from her collection. When approached by artists who wanted to work with her but for whose work she had no feeling, she refused.</p>

<p>M&egrave;ge felt strongly that no money should be exchanged in these interactions. (&#8220;As soon as there&#8217;s a question of payment, it&#8217;s dead, you fall asleep,&#8221; she told me.) She also asked each artist to sign a contract printed on a three-inch slip of paper, stating that she would have the right to exhibit or publish the image for noncommercial reasons only.</p></blockquote>

<p>M&egrave;ge&#8217;s project fits neatly into contemporary selfie culture. Her collection reminds me of other creative people who have incorporated themselves into their media of behalf of someone or something else. Call them &#8220;selfie auteurs&#8221;. <a href="http://lonelysandwich.com/">Adam Lisagor</a> has starred in many of the videos <a href="http://sandwichvideo.com/">his company</a> makes for tech clients. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">Casey Neistat</a> films himself going on adventures for clients like J. Crew and Nike. <a href="http://noahkalina.com/">Noah Kalina</a> was commissioned by VH1 to take photos of himself <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/549b9edce4b0a47d0addf875/54a9f842e4b0d6033e4f2537/54a9fa79e4b0421d699aee99/1420425850222/6.jpg">posing with celebrities</a> in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPPzXlMdi7o">Everyday</a> stance. I&#8217;m sure there are many more examples<sup id="fnref:1475593319"><a href="#fn:1475593319" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but few have done it as cleanly and purely as M&egrave;ge.</p>

<ol><li class="footnote" id="fn:1475593319"><p>Maybe kottke.org should be in this list as well. This is my website &#8212; my name&#8217;s right at the top for crying out loud &#8212; and I share my opinion about things here all the time, but in a significant way, the site isn&#8217;t actually about me. It&#8217;s mainly about other people&#8217;s work and ideas. Sure, if you read long enough you learn about who I am as a person in the process, but it&#8217;s not the point.<a href="#fnref:1475593319" title="return to article">&#x21A9;</a><p></li></ol>]]>
